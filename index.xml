      <description>I am a last year undergraduate student studying computer engineering at university of tehran. My research interests include (but are not limited to üòä) algorithm design and complexity; I specially enjoy working on combinatorial optimization problems and working with discrete data structures. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on algorithms with predictions for graph problems and the detour problem.
From July 2023 to October 2023, I was a research asisstant at SUFE under the supervision of B.</description>

      <description>I enjoy teaching very much. Infact, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of my undergraduate years teaching and learning how to teach. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief description of my favorite contibutions:
- Algorithm Design üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Description: A challenging course covering essential algorithmic methods such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, graph algorithms, network flow analysis, and the concept of NP problems. Role: Help design course material, organize the teaching staff, manage students‚Äô activities, deliver lectures, and provid one-on-one guidance to students.</description>
